4. SOURCES AND METHODS

Break in series: late reports 
Until 2010, reports on events taking place in a certain year received by Statistics Netherlands after 15 February in the following year were disregarded. These are so-called late reports. 
As a result of an improvement in the production process, from 2010 these late reports are included in the year of publication (i.e. not in the year the event took place, but in the year the results are published). 

Break in series
From 2010 onwards a small shift has occurred between a number of marital statuses (fewer never married and more married, divorced and widowed respectively).
Because information on some marital statuses was lacking for the period 1998 to 2010 in data used by Statistics Netherlands, 'partnership', 'divorced after partnership' and 'widowed after partnership' were not included in these statistics for this period. For these statistics, the marital status before the partnership was used instead, which was mostly 'never married'. From 2010 all marital statuses are available.

Population
The figures in the table refer to the registered population in the Netherlands.
The statistics are based on information received from the municipal population register. The data refer to all persons entered in the municipal population register (the 'de jure' population). 
Essentially, all persons residing in the Netherlands for an indefinite period of time are entered in the population register of the municipality where they usually spend the night (place of residence). People without a fixed abode but belonging to the 'de jure' population are entered in the population register of The Hague.
Accuracy and reliability
The information received by Statistics Netherlands is occasionally incomplete. In such cases, the lacking data are estimated.

Used sources outside statistics Netherlands Municipal population register.
